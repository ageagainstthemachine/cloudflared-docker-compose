# cloudflared-docker-compose

A simple Docker compose file that runs the cloudflared for setting up a tunnel.

## Usage
Clone/download the compose file and change TOKEN_HERE to the tunnel token. Bring the compose file up and the tunnel should form. Then, configure further on the Cloudflare side to point the tunnel to the internal target.

Like everything else on the internet, run at your own risk.
